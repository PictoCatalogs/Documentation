# About the project

### Project

This research project is carried out by **Frédérine Pradier (University of Geneva)**. It aims to study photographic amateurism at the turn of the 20th century through catalogues of international pictorialist exhibitions and by means of quantitative and computational methods. Our corpus is composed of **pictorialist photography exhibition catalogs (1891-1914)** from the **Metropolitan Museum of Art Library (Joyce F. Menschel Photography Library)**, available [here](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/libraries-and-research-centers/watson-digital-collections/rare-materials-in-the-met-libraries/pictorialist-photography-exhibition-catalogs-1891-1914).

### Abstract

The rise of photographic amateurism was marked by technical and industrial progress, which allowed the widespread distribution of new, simplified products and specialised publications. Pictorialism developed within an associative network, the photographic societies, privileged places for the circulation of ideas and images, which became one of the fundamental social structures of the photographic world at the end of the 19th century. In the clubs and societies, many amateurs claimed to be artistic photographers in order to distinguish themselves. The Pictorialists thus positioned themselves as enlightened amateurs, in opposition to the popularised private practice of photography but also to the commercial practice of professional photographers.

The serial analysis of the catalogues allows us to interrogate this moment in the history of photographic amateurism and its artistic expression in Pictorialist circles from a social, cultural and spatial point of view. By extracting, enriching and analysing data about the exhibitors, works and advertisements present in these exhibition catalogues, we wish to shed light on the boundary that seems to separate amateurism that is exhibited in the public sphere from that which is practised in the private sphere.

The methodology used for this study consists, on the one hand, in the extraction of textual data from the catalogues, thanks to the training of models allowing to segment and transcribe a part of the corpus. The [workflow](https://github.com/IMAGO-Catalogues-Jjanes/extractionCatalogs) developed for the exhibition catalogues as part of the [Artl@s](https://artlas.huma-num.fr/fr/) project then makes it possible to extract the data in a structured manner in order to proceed with their analysis. The other part of this study concerns the analysis of images, in particular reproductions of photographs and advertisements in these catalogues. The themes, style, motifs, circulation and chronology of these images are analysed. They are indexed and studied with quantitative methods but also with clustering methods, thanks to the [Explore](https://visualcontagions.unige.ch/explore/) platform of the [Visual Contagions](https://www.unige.ch/visualcontagions/) project.
